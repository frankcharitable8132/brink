# Changelog

All notable changes to Brink are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **macOS: the app crashed on launch on every Mac except the build machine** (#8). Resources are now shipped in `Contents/Resources` and read via `Bundle.main` instead of SwiftPM's `Bundle.module`, whose accessor only knew the build machine's path. Thanks @nadalpiantini for the precise report.

### Added
- Homebrew tap: `brew tap semihtalii/brink && brew install --cask brink` (cask strips quarantine, no Gatekeeper dance).
- winget manifest under `packaging/winget/` (`SemihTali.Brink`, pending submission to winget-pkgs).
- Releases now ship `SHA256SUMS-*.txt` and a GitHub build-provenance attestation for both the DMG and the Windows zip.
- Issue and pull-request templates.

### Changed
- macOS build is a **universal binary** (arm64 + x86_64); 0.5.0 and earlier were Apple Silicon only.
- README: correct first-launch steps for macOS 15+ (Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway, or `xattr -d`); uninstall notes; comparison table now lists CodexBar and ClaudeBar.
- GitHub release notes are generated from this changelog instead of the commit list.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Brink for Windows** — native C# / WPF port in `windows/`, with the same rings, detail card, notifications, 10 languages, launch at login and provider handling. Ships as a single self-contained `Brink.exe` (`Brink-Windows-x64.zip`) built by GitHub Actions on every release.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Cursor** provider: included / auto / API usage (and on-demand when enabled) from the Cursor CLI login. Thanks @BryanPinheiro77 (#1).
- Empty state: when no CLI is signed in, a single "?" ring explains what to install instead of showing demo numbers.

### Changed
- Providers without credentials are hidden by default; switch them on in **Providers** to see a DEMO ring.
- Claude: on 429 Brink quietly retries twice within ~5 s before backing off (min 30 s) — no more "Rate limited" note on a fresh launch.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- Claude: on HTTP 429 the app now backs off for the `Retry-After` window and keeps showing the last good numbers instead of blanking the ring and re-polling. Thanks @fherryfherry (#2).
- Translations for the new rate-limit messages in all 10 languages.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- **Providers** menu: choose which rings are shown (e.g. Claude only). Hidden providers don't notify either. At least one stays visible.

### Changed
- Detail card tail is now an arrow pointing at the ring (design v3); thicker ring stroke, thinner bars.
- Whole panel ~10 % smaller.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Notifications: when any usage window (session / weekly / per-model) reaches 100 %, and again when it resets — the reset one is scheduled for the exact reset time. Toggle + test item in the menu.
- Localization in 10 languages, following the macOS system language by default; **Language** menu to override.
- Panel folds away when the mouse moves far (> 480 pt) from the edge.

### Changed
- Liquid Glass / System now use Apple's adaptive `.regular` glass with system text styles, so type flips light/dark with the background.
- Slimmer proportions from the v2 design (78 pt tab, 48 pt rings, 296 pt card); card shadow removed.
- Right-click menu available on the detail card as well.

### Fixed
- Token rotation by Claude Code no longer shows "Unauthorized" until the next cycle — Brink re-reads and retries immediately.
- CI builds on `macos-26` (required for the Liquid Glass SDK).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Appearance menu: **Black**, **Liquid Glass**, **System** — real Liquid Glass (`.glassEffect`) on macOS 26+, `NSVisualEffectView` blur on older systems; choice persisted.
- Notch-style tab shape, hover-scaling rings, detail card that glides between rings with a crossfade.
- Provider logos as template images.
- Right-click anywhere on the panel or the detail card for the settings menu.
- If Claude Code rotates its token, Brink re-reads it and retries immediately instead of showing "Unauthorized" until the next cycle.
- `BRINK_PREVIEW=1` starts expanded with the first card open (screenshots / design review).
- Right-edge slide-out panel with a usage ring per provider and a detail card on hover.
- Claude Code source: reads the OAuth token from the macOS Keychain (`Claude Code-credentials`) or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`; parses Anthropic's structured `limits` response (session / all models / per-model weekly) with a fallback for the older `five_hour` / `seven_day` shape.
- Codex source: reads `~/.codex/auth.json` and the ChatGPT usage endpoint.
- Auto-refresh every 2 minutes; **Refresh now** and **Quit** in the context menu.
- **Launch at login** toggle (SMAppService).
- `build.sh` producing `Brink.app` and `Brink.dmg`; GitHub Actions release on `v*` tags.

### Security
- Only the short-lived access token and its expiry are cached locally (`0600`). Refresh tokens are never stored and Brink never refreshes tokens itself, so it cannot invalidate Claude Code's session.
